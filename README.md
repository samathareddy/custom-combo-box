Custom Combo Box
===========

jQuery plugin allowing users to enter a custom field within the combo (dropdown) box itself.

See index.html and customComboBox.js for a demo and detailed comments explaining how to use the plugin.

Tested in IE6-9, Chrome, and Firefox.

This screenshot, taken directly from the index.html demo page, shows values in the "Pizza Toppings" dropdown box.  The user manually entered "Tomatoes," which created a fourth option in the combo box.
